Project management ensures that projects are completed efficiently and effectively by applying structured methodologies, tools, and best practices.*

**Public process:** *In business process modeling, a public process is a workflow that is visible to external parties, such as business partners, customers, or other organizations. Unlike private processes that detail an organization’s internal operations, a public process outlines the interactions, message exchanges, and collaboration points between organizations. It serves as an interface, specifying how communication with the outside world occurs while shielding confidential internal activities to maintain both clarity and security.*

**RACI:** *A responsibility assignment matrix used to clarify roles and responsibilities within a process or project. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed—four key involvement types assigned to team members or stakeholders for each task or deliverable. The matrix helps ensure accountability, prevents confusion, and enhances communication by explicitly defining who is responsible for executing tasks, who is accountable for final decisions, who must be consulted for input or expertise, and who needs to be informed about progress or outcomes.*

**Receive task:** *In business process modeling, a receive task is a type of activity that waits for and accepts messages or data from external sources, such as systems, processes, or parties. This task, typically automated, is triggered when the expected input arrives—like an incoming email, file, or service response—allowing the workflow to continue. Receive tasks enable asynchronous communication and coordination between processes, ensuring subsequent steps commence only after receipt of necessary information.*

**Repository:** *A centralized location where data, documents, code, or other digital assets are stored, managed, and organized for easy access and retrieval. In business and technology contexts, repositories are essential for ensuring that information is systematically maintained, version-controlled, and shared among authorized users or teams, supporting collaboration, transparency, and consistency across processes and projects.*

**Return on Investment (ROI):** *A financial metric used to analyze the profitability or efficiency of an investment. ROI compares the net gain or loss produced by an initiative relative to the amount of resources invested, typically presented as a percentage. It helps organizations assess the value of projects, measure success, and inform future decision-making.*

**Return On Investment (ROI):** *A key financial metric used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment.

This measurement helps organizations assess the value and impact of projects, initiatives, or process improvements by quantifying the financial return relative to the resources allocated.*

**Revenue growth:** *The increase in a company’s sales or income over a specific period, typically measured as a percentage. Revenue growth is a key indicator of business expansion and financial health, reflecting the company’s ability to generate higher earnings from its products or services compared to previous periods.*

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** *The use of software robots, or “bots,” to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks within business processes. RPA enables organizations to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human employees to focus on higher-value activities by mimicking human interactions with digital systems. This technology is commonly applied to tasks such as data entry, invoice processing, and customer service operations.*

**Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM):** *An early cost or effort estimate provided during the initial stages of a project or initiative. A ROM estimate is typically based on limited information and is meant to give stakeholders a general sense of potential costs or resource requirements, often with a wide accuracy range (such as -25% to +75%). As the project progresses and more details become available, the estimate is refined to improve accuracy.*

**Script Task:** *A task within a business process that executes a specified script written in a programming or scripting language. When the process reaches this step, the script runs automatically, enabling the automation of routine or repetitive operations without requiring human intervention.*

**Script Task:** A task within a business process that is designed to automatically execute a script written in a specific programming or scripting language when this step is reached. Script tasks enable the automation of routine or repetitive operations, reducing the need for manual effort and ensuring efficiency in process execution.

**Send task:** *In business process modeling, a send task is an automated activity designed to transmit a message or data to an external party, system, or process. It is typically executed by a software application without requiring human intervention. Send tasks are used to initiate communication, trigger workflows, or notify stakeholders by dispatching emails, messages, or files, ensuring timely and consistent information flow within or between business processes.*

**Sequence flow:** *In business process modeling, particularly within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a sequence flow is a type of connecting object that shows the order in which activities, events, or gateways are executed within a process. Represented by a solid arrow, sequence flows link flow elements together, illustrating the progression from one step to the next and ensuring the logical sequencing of actions throughout the workflow.*

**Sequential MI:** *A multi-instance construct in which repetitions of a task or sub-process are performed one after another, rather than at the same time. In business process modeling, Sequential MI ensures that each instance is executed in sequence, with the completion of one leading directly to the initiation of the next. This structure is used when tasks must be handled in a specific order, maintaining process flow integrity and allowing for stepwise evaluation or dependency between instances.*

**Service Level Agreement (SLA):** *A formal agreement between a service provider and a client that specifies the expected level of service, including measurable performance standards, responsibilities, and response times. SLAs help ensure accountability by outlining the consequences for failing to meet agreed-upon service criteria, promoting transparency and alignment of expectations.*

They help streamline and automate workflows, ensuring consistency and efficiency in business processes.*

**Service-oriented architecture (SOA):** *An architectural approach in software design where applications are built from independent, reusable services that communicate over a network. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be integrated or reused in different applications, supporting flexibility, scalability, and easier system integration.*

**Signal event:** *In business process modeling, a signal event represents the broadcast or receipt of a generic signal within or across process boundaries. Unlike message events, which are directed to specific participants, signal events are broadcast globally to all appropriate receivers. A signal event can be used as a trigger to initiate actions in multiple processes or subprocesses simultaneously, promoting asynchronous communication and coordination. Signal events are valuable for modeling scenarios where a process needs to react to system-wide notifications or changes—such as status updates, alerts, or the completion of certain activities—without a predetermined recipient.*

**Silo thinking:** *A mindset or organizational behavior in which departments, teams, or individuals operate in isolation, focusing solely on their own goals and activities rather than collaborating or sharing information with other parts of the organization. Silo thinking can hinder communication, reduce efficiency, and prevent the organization from achieving its broader objectives by limiting cross-functional cooperation and the flow of knowledge.*

**SIPOC:** *An acronym that stands for Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers. SIPOC is a high-level process mapping tool commonly used in process improvement initiatives to provide a broad overview of a process. The SIPOC diagram helps teams identify and document the key elements of a process by visually mapping out who supplies the needed inputs, what those inputs are, the main steps or activities of the process itself, what outputs are produced, and who the end customers are. This structured approach ensures clarity, alignment, and a shared understanding among stakeholders before delving into more detailed analysis or redesign.*

**Smart Actions:** *Tasks or operations executed by a system, often leveraging artificial intelligence or automation, designed to respond efficiently to real-time data, user input, or contextual changes. These actions aim to optimize processes, reduce manual intervention, and drive goal-oriented outcomes within digital environments or workflows.*

**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** *A cloud-based software delivery model in which applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to users over the internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software on individual computers or servers, users access SaaS applications through a web browser, typically via a subscription model. This approach enables automatic updates, scalability, centralized management, and reduced IT overhead, making it a popular choice for businesses seeking flexible and cost-effective software solutions.*

**Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) objectives:** *A structured framework for setting clear and effective goals. SMART objectives are designed to be well-defined (Specific), include quantitative or qualitative criteria for success (Measurable), realistic given available resources (Achievable), aligned with broader organizational priorities (Relevant), and constrained by a defined timeframe (Time-bound). This approach ensures goals are actionable, trackable, and support accountability throughout the process.*

**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):** *A documented set of step-by-step instructions designed to guide team members in carrying out routine operations or processes consistently and efficiently. SOPs ensure standardization, quality control, and compliance with regulations or organizational policies, helping to minimize errors and maintain best practices across an organization.*

**Start event:** *In business process modeling, especially within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a start event marks the point at which a process begins. It visually represents the initial trigger or occurrence that sets a process in motion, such as the receipt of a message, a specific date, or a signal. The start event is typically depicted as a circle and helps define how and when a business process is initiated.*

**Straight Through Process:** *An automated workflow or process that completes from start to finish without manual intervention. In business operations, straight through processing (STP) enables data and transactions to flow seamlessly across systems, reducing delays, minimizing errors, and increasing efficiency by eliminating the need for human handling at each step.*

**Strategic adaptability:** *The capacity of an organization, team, or individual to anticipate, respond to, and manage change in a dynamic environment. Strategic adaptability involves proactively adjusting goals, strategies, and processes to address shifting market conditions, emerging trends, technological advances, or unexpected challenges. This quality enables sustained success by fostering resilience, innovation, and continuous improvement in pursuit of long-term objectives.*

SMEs are often consulted to provide guidance, validate information, answer technical questions, or contribute insights during projects, process improvements, training, or decision-making. Their deep understanding makes them valuable resources in ensuring accuracy, quality, and effectiveness within their areas of specialization.*

**Sub-optimization:** *The situation in which a department, team, or individual within an organization focuses on optimizing its own processes or goals at the expense of the broader objectives of the entire system. Sub-optimization can lead to inefficiencies, conflicts, or missed opportunities for the organization as a whole, as improvements in one area may negatively impact overall performance or value delivery.*

**Sub-process:** *In business process modeling, especially within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a sub-process is a type of activity that represents a collection of related tasks or steps grouped together within a larger process. Sub-processes help to break down complex workflows into more manageable and understandable components, allowing modelers to encapsulate details and promote clarity. Visually, a sub-process is often depicted as a rounded rectangle with a plus sign, indicating that it contains additional, detailed activities that can be expanded or collapsed as needed in the diagram.*

**Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR):** *A process-based framework developed by the Supply Chain Council (now part of APICS) to standardize, evaluate, and improve supply chain performance. The SCOR model provides organizations with a comprehensive reference for mapping supply chain processes, benchmarking practices, and identifying opportunities for improvement across key areas such as planning, sourcing, production, delivery, and returns. By offering a common language and set of metrics, SCOR enables organizations to optimize end-to-end supply chain operations and drive efficiency, agility, and customer satisfaction.*

**Support processes (also known as supporting or enabling processes):** *Functions, activities, or operations within an organization that do not directly contribute to the production of goods or delivery of core services, but are essential for enabling and sustaining primary value-adding activities. These processes—such as IT support, HR management, and maintenance—provide infrastructure, resources, and organizational capabilities that help ensure efficient, compliant, and consistent performance across the business.*

**Swimlane:** *In business process modeling, especially within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a swim lane is a visual element used to organize and categorize activities within a process diagram. Swim lanes subdivide pools into separate rows or columns, each representing a specific role, department, system, or participant involved in the process. This structure helps clarify responsibilities and interactions by showing which participant is responsible for each step or activity, making complex processes easier to understand and analyze.*

**Synchronization:** *In business process modeling, synchronization refers to the coordination point where multiple parallel process paths converge, ensuring that all concurrent activities are completed before the process continues. This is commonly achieved using gateways—such as a parallel gateway (AND)—that wait for all incoming flows to finish before allowing the next step to proceed. Synchronization is essential for maintaining consistency and order in processes that involve simultaneous tasks or events, guaranteeing that every required action is finalized prior to advancing to the following stage.*

**Systems Modeling Language (SysML):** *A standardized modeling language specifically designed for systems engineering. SysML provides a set of graphical notations and diagrams—such as requirement, block definition, internal block, and activity diagrams—to specify, analyze, design, and verify complex systems that may include hardware, software, information, personnel, and processes. It facilitates communication among stakeholders and supports the development and management of multidisciplinary systems throughout their life cycle.*

**Task mining:** *A technique that involves automatically capturing, analyzing, and interpreting how users interact with software applications to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities for process improvement. Task mining uses data from user actions—such as clicks, keystrokes, and screen activities—to reconstruct workflows and gain insights into day-to-day operations, enabling organizations to optimize processes, enhance productivity, and support digital transformation initiatives.*

**Task:** *In business process modeling, especially within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a task is a type of activity that represents a single, atomic unit of work. Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of a process, typically depicted as rectangles with rounded corners. Each task describes a specific action or operation performed by a participant in the process and does not contain further sub-processes or steps within it. Tasks help define the sequence and responsibilities of work within the overall business workflow.*

**Terminate event:** *In business process modeling, a terminate event is a specific type of event that, when triggered, immediately ends the entire process or sub-process in which it occurs. All ongoing and parallel activities are halted instantly, and no further actions take place, regardless of their current status. Terminate events are used to guarantee a complete and unconditional stop to process execution, typically in response to conditions that make further processing unnecessary or undesirable.*

**Text annotation:** *In business process modeling, particularly within BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a text annotation is an artifact used to add descriptive notes or explanations to elements within a process diagram. Text annotations are connected to specific objects or areas using a dashed line, providing clarifying information, context, or commentary to enhance understanding of the model without affecting the execution or flow of the process itself.*

**Throwing (active) event:** *In business process modeling, a throwing (active) event signifies a point within a process where an action is initiated, causing a specific trigger to be sent or an occurrence to be announced. Unlike catching (passive) events, which await the arrival of a trigger, throwing events actively generate outputs such as messages, signals, or escalations that influence other processes or elements within the workflow. These events are fundamental for orchestrating communication, controlling the flow between parallel processes, or signaling changes that require attention or response elsewhere in the model.*

**Timer event:** *In business process modeling, a timer event is a type of event that is triggered by a specific temporal condition, such as a particular date, time, or recurring interval. Timer events can be used as start, intermediate, or boundary events within a process, enabling automated actions to occur at scheduled times or after defined delays. These events are essential for scheduling tasks, implementing deadlines, handling timeouts, and ensuring that processes progress according to time-based requirements. Timer events enhance process control and allow workflows to be responsive to timing constraints and periodic operations.*

**TO-BE processes:** *The envisioned or future state of business processes after improvements, redesign, or transformation initiatives have been implemented. TO-BE processes are typically documented and mapped to illustrate how workflows, roles, technologies, and activities will function once changes are made, serving as a blueprint for achieving desired organizational goals and performance enhancements.*

**Token:** *In business process modeling, a token represents an abstract marker or placeholder that moves through a process diagram, indicating the progress of process execution. Tokens are not physical objects but serve as notional indicators used to track which path is currently active within the process flow, particularly in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). As a process instance proceeds, tokens are generated at the start event and traverse through activities, gateways, and events, following the process's sequence flows. The movement and behavior of tokens help to visualize, simulate, and analyze the dynamics and branching of business processes.*

**Transaction sub-process:** *In business process modeling, a transaction sub-process is a specialized type of sub-process that represents a set of activities grouped together as a single, atomic transaction. This means that all activities within the transaction sub-process must be completed successfully for the process to be considered complete; if any activity fails or a cancel event is triggered, the entire transaction is rolled back, and compensation or corrective actions are initiated as defined. Transaction sub-processes ensure consistency and integrity within business processes by managing complex sequences of work as unified, recoverable operations.*

**Unified Modeling Language (UML):** *A standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the structure and behavior of software systems. UML provides a set of graphical notations and diagrams—such as class, sequence, and activity diagrams—to represent various aspects of system design, supporting communication among stakeholders and aiding in the development, analysis, and maintenance of complex software and business processes.*

**User task:** *In business process modeling, a user task is an activity assigned to a specific person or role and is performed with the assistance of software or an application interface. Unlike manual tasks, user tasks involve interaction between a human and a system—such as completing a form, reviewing and approving documents on a platform, or entering data into an application. User tasks help coordinate work that requires both human judgment and system support, bridging the gap between automated and manual processes.*

**Value adding (VA):** *Activities, processes, or resources within an organization that directly contribute to the creation or enhancement of value for customers or stakeholders. Value adding elements transform inputs into outputs that meet customer needs, improve products or services, or provide tangible benefits, distinguishing them from supporting or enabling activities that do not directly generate value.*

**Value chain:** *A sequence of activities or processes through which a company adds value to its products or services, from initial concept and raw materials to final delivery and after-sales support. The value chain framework helps identify each step that contributes to creating value for the customer, highlighting opportunities for optimization and competitive advantage across the organization.*

**Value creation:** *The process by which an organization, activity, or individual generates benefits or worth for customers, stakeholders, or society. Value creation involves transforming resources, skills, or knowledge into products, services, or solutions that meet needs, solve problems, or enhance well-being.*

**Value Delivery Modeling Language (VDML):** *A standardized modeling language designed to describe, analyze, and optimize the creation and delivery of value within organizations. VDML provides a framework for representing value streams, business activities, resources, and relationships, supporting business model innovation, process improvement, and strategic decision-making by illustrating how value is generated and transferred among stakeholders.*

**Value enabling (VE):** *Activities, resources, or processes that support or facilitate the creation and delivery of value to customers or stakeholders, but do not directly add value themselves. Value enabling processes make it possible for value-adding activities to function effectively by providing necessary infrastructure, information, or support.*

**Value proposition:** *A clear statement that summarizes the unique benefits, value, or advantages a product, service, or organization offers to its customers. The value proposition explains why a customer should choose one offering over competitors by addressing how it solves problems, fulfills needs, or improves a situation.*

**Waste:** *Any activity, process, or resource consumption within an organization that does not directly contribute to value creation or delivery for customers or stakeholders. Waste often includes inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, or unnecessary steps that consume time, effort, or materials without adding benefit, and is a key focus for elimination in process improvement methodologies such as Lean.*

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** *A financial metric that represents a company’s average cost of funds from both equity and debt sources, weighted according to their proportion in the overall capital structure. WACC is used to evaluate investment opportunities and determine the minimum return a company must earn to satisfy its investors and creditors.*

**Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC):** *An international organization founded to develop standards for workflow management systems and business process interoperability. The WfMC promotes guidelines and specifications that enable different workflow products and tools to work together, with a focus on improving automation and integration of business processes across various platforms.*
