# Additional resources for Chapter 11

You had a chance to learn about the different aspects of process modeling. But, as you know, there are also many other aspects of business process management which we did not cover in depth. Also, there are several related domains, that can provide useful insights and techniques for BPM practitioners. Finally, there are so many new concepts and tools appearing that you need to learn continuously to stay current. 

Below you can see a list of suggested resources that will help you dig deeper, if some of those topics sound interesting for you.

## Process Mining
My first contact with Process Mining was an awesome course on Coursera **[Process Mining: Data science in Action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining)** by Professor Wil van der Aalst. If you want to understand the theory behind the Process Mining and have 10+ hours this is a great choice! 

If you prefer a shorter introduction along with the overview of such important PM scenarios such as Process discovery, Conformance checking, and  Performance analysis, check the wonderful resources available on https://processmining.org/. Apart from the introduction, you will also find there an overview of PM tools, courses, books, and more! 

Please note that the **[Process Mining Handbook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-08848-3)** whose editors are Wil van der Aalst and Josep Carmona is an Open Access publication, so you can download it for free.

Lastly, I would like to recommend you the latest book by Roland Woldt **[Successful Process Mining Projects: A practical guide on how to do good process mining analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Successful-Process-Mining-Projects-practical-ebook/dp/B0FNNQ38HT/)**. I had a chance to review it and it is great!


## Business Analysis
Process modeling is a useful tool not only for BPM practitioners, but also for Business Analysts. And more importantly, each transformation project needs business analysts who can help move from vague vision to reality. If you like working with people and helping organizations create value, perhaps BA can be an interesting career choice for you?

If so, you need to to read the recently published book of Laura Brandenburg **[The Value-Driven Business Analyst](https://www.amazon.com/Value-Driven-Business-Analyst-Laura-Brandenburg-ebook/dp/B0D96KS69X/)**. 

When you look at the Business Analyst Manifesto opening the book (“… But most of all, we create positive change for the organizations we serve.”) you can see that this book was written not only by an expert, but also by a person who thinks about the impact of work and genuinely cares about other people. 

Laura guides you through the eight-step business analysis process, shows you different tools and techniques, and shares a lot of stories. As an additional bonus, Laura shows dozens of ways in which you can use the GenAI tools in your work.

If the world of BA looks interesting and you want to explore it further, I have two more recommendations for you:
a) check the list of BA books provided by Adrian Reed (https://www.adrianreed.co.uk/reading-list/) and subscribe to his quarterly BA Digest: https://www.blackmetric.com/ba-digest/ 

b) visit the website of International Institute of Business Analysis (https://www.iiba.org/) and see what do they have to offer. Even if you do not plan to become a Business Analyst, ideas covered in the (new) Business Analysis Standard document (https://go.iiba.org/The-Standard) will help you in your process management or transformation activities. By the way, IIBA also organizes an inspiring conference https://buildingbusinesscapability.com/ with lots of interesting sessions about processes.

## Lean
Lean Management which was covered several times in our book is a very broad and fascinating discipline. You can learn more e.g., by visiting https://www.lean.org 

One of the important aspects of Lean is elimination of waste (i.e., non-value adding activities) also called Muda. Waste can take many forms. Using the probably most popular acronym **TIMWOODS** it can be: (unnecessary) Transportation, (excessive) Inventory, (non-ergonomic) Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defect, and (unused) Skills. Great explanation of the 8 wastes of Lean can be found on https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/8-wastes-of-lean/.


## Certification
If you want to make sure that you have a good foundation of BPM knowledge you may want to follow the certification path as well.

There are many options. If you want to show that you know well not only the BPMN notation, but also other standards, Object Management Group Certified Expert in BPM (OCEB 2) may be something for you! You can learn more on https://www.omg.org/certification/bpm/. Disclosure: I have a pleasure of working in a team preparing the content for this certification.

Since there are many sources of knowledge covered in OCEB, you may also want to explore books written for people preparing for this exam: **[Holistic Business Process Management: Successful with BPMN 2.0 and OCEB 2 Fundamental](https://www.amazon.com/Holistic-Business-Process-Management-Fundamental/dp/B09FCCMDX5/)** by Serge Schiltz and **[OCEB 2 Certification Guide: Business Process Management - Fundamental Level](https://www.amazon.com/OCEB-Certification-Guide-Management-Fundamental-ebook/dp/B01J2BH87U)** by Tim Weilkiens, Christian Weiss, Andrea Grass, and Kim Nena Duggen.

Additional certification options are offered by ABPMP: CBPA (Certified Business Process Associate), CBPP (Certified Business Process Professional), and CBPL (Certified Business Process Leader). You can learn more on: https://www.abpmp.org/page/certification_home

If you are thinking of passing the CBPA/CBPP exams apart from the BPM Common Body of Knowledge (BPM CBOK), you may also find useful the book **[Foundations of Business Process Management: Prepare for ABPMP's CBPA/CBPP certifications](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Business-Process-Management-certifications/dp/B0F5M3QR84/)** written by Serge Schiltz and Joshua Ara.

Very popular certification option are the Method and Style courses by Bruce Silver: https://www.methodandstyle.com/bpmn-training/. 


## Keep learning
There are so many new topics in BPM every month! If you want to stay up to date I have a few suggestions that you may find helpful.

a) As a blogger I will of course start with blogs! Find few blogs covering BPM that you enjoy reading. For me, one of the favorites is blog written by Sandy Kemsley: https://column2.com/

b) You may also like aggregators providing an overview of content from many sources. Two great examples are https://www.businessprocessincubator.com/ and recently created by Mirko Kloppenburg https://bpm.today/

c) If you like podcasts, here are some recommendations for you! The **[New Process Podcast](https://newprocesslab.com/new-process-podcast/)** with Mirko Kloppenburg, **[What’s Your Baseline?](https://www.whatsyourbaseline.com/podcast/)** with Roland Woldt and J-M Erlendson, and **[BPM360 Podcast](https://www.bpm360podcast.com/)** with Russell Gomersall and Caspar Jans are great places to see (hear?) what’s happening in BPM.

d) You may also like to follow some BPM experts e.g., on LinkedIn. As a starting point I would like to suggest you awesome people who participate in the "BPM Skills" series on my blog: https://bpmtips.com/category/bpm-skills/. 

e) Finally, conferences. Many interesting events (both online and offline) are hosted by IQPC. You can follow them on https://www.processexcellencenetwork.com/. If you like to hear people from academia to have a preview of upcoming trends and best practices, probably the best place to be is the yearly event from the BPM conference series: https://bpm-conference.org/.

If you want to suggest some additional resources for the book you can contact me at: zbigniew@bpmtips.com (please use the "Practical Business Process Modeling and Analysis" as a title). You can also reach out with questions, comments, and suggestions regarding further content which you would like to see from us.

Last, but not least: we hope you will find our book useful and nice to read. If you like it, please leave a review on Amazon!
