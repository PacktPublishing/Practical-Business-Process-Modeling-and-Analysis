# Additional resources for Chapter 7

## Further reading
If you want to learn more about the modeling notations covered in this chapter (and more), I suggest you check out the following books and resources:
* If you would like to learn more about the history of BPMN and its relationship with other standards, such as XPDL, I would recommend a very interesting free paper, Business Process
Model and Notationâ€”BPMN, by Mark von Rosing, Stephen White, Fred Cummins, and Henk de Man, available at https://www.omg.org/news/whitepapers/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation.pdf. You can also read the full book, **[The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM, Volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Business-Process-Handbook-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B00R4DX61Q)**, by Mark von Rosing, Henrik von Scheel, and August-Wilhelm Scheer.
* If UML is something you would like to explore further, I would suggest checking out this resource from my go-to expert in UML Filip Stachecki: visit https://www.uml-diagrams.org/
for a great overview of what UML has to offer.
* If you prefer learning from books, on https://modeling-languages.com/list-uml-books/, you will find a list of many great titles. This website offers many useful resources about UML modeling (and more) as well.
* Finally, I would recommend https://agilemodeling.com/ by Scott Ambler.
